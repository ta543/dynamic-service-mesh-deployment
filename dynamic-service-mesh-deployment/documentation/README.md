# Dynamic Multi-Cloud Service Mesh Deployment

## Overview

This project automates the deployment of a highly available and secure service mesh across multiple cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure) using a combination of Terraform for infrastructure provisioning and Ansible for configuration management. It leverages Kubernetes for container orchestration and Istio for the service mesh to create a robust, cloud-agnostic environment for microservices deployment.

## Features

- **Multi-Cloud Deployment**: Seamlessly deploy across AWS, GCP, and Azure to leverage the unique services and geographic locations of each provider.
- **Automated Infrastructure**: Utilize Terraform to provision and manage cloud resources with Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles.
- **Configurable Service Mesh**: Deploy and configure Istio across all Kubernetes clusters with Ansible, enabling advanced traffic management, security, and observability features.
- **High Availability and Scalability**: Configure Kubernetes clusters and Istio for high availability, ensuring services remain accessible and resilient to failures.
- **Secure by Design**: Implement security best practices, including network policies, mutual TLS (mTLS) for service communication, and role-based access control (RBAC).
