# üåê Dynamic Multi-Cloud Service Mesh Deployment Project

This repository houses the Dynamic Multi-Cloud Service Mesh Deployment Project, a solution I developed to orchestrate a seamless and secure service mesh across AWS, GCP, and Azure. The project automates cloud infrastructure provisioning with Terraform, manages Kubernetes clusters via Ansible, and utilizes Istio to unify service communication, security, and monitoring across different cloud environments. It's designed to tackle the challenges of managing services in diverse cloud ecosystems for organizations adopting a multi-cloud strategy.

## Overview

The motivation behind this project was to create a framework that supports the deployment of microservices in a way that's not dependent on any single cloud provider. It focuses on high availability, scalability, and security, removing the complexity of cloud infrastructure management so that development teams can concentrate on application development.

## Features

- **Automated Multi-Cloud Provisioning:** Sets up and manages infrastructure across AWS, GCP, and Azure using Terraform, facilitating consistent deployments.
  
- **Unified Service Mesh with Istio:** Creates a cohesive service mesh across cloud providers with Istio, supporting secure communication, traffic management, and observability.

- **Configurable and Scalable:** Offers flexible and scalable configuration for Kubernetes clusters and Istio through Ansible playbooks, meeting a variety of deployment needs.

- **Enhanced Security and Observability:** Integrates Istio's security features for encrypted communication and provides tools for monitoring and tracing microservices.

- **High Availability and Disaster Recovery:** Designed for resilience, with multi-region deployments and auto-scaling to ensure service availability.
